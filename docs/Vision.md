# CLAI - Command Line AI
## An AI-Native Terminal Emulator

### Executive Summary

CLAI reimagines the command line interface by seamlessly blending natural language interaction with traditional terminal functionality. Users can converse with AI to accomplish complex tasks while maintaining full visibility and control over terminal operations. The AI observes, understands, and collaborates in real-time, making the terminal accessible to newcomers while empowering experts with intelligent automation.

### Vision

A terminal where you type naturally and the AI understands whether you want to execute a command or accomplish a goal. One unified input that handles both "show me disk usage" and `df -h` with equal fluency. The AI maintains context across sessions, learns from your patterns, and can orchestrate complex multi-step operations across multiple terminals while you maintain the ability to interrupt, redirect, or take control at any moment.

### Core Principles

1. **Natural Language First** - Default to AI interpretation of user intent
2. **Full Transparency** - Every command executed is visible in real-time
3. **User Sovereignty** - Interrupt, override, or take manual control instantly
4. **Persistent Context** - Remember learnings and state across sessions
5. **Real-time Collaboration** - AI observes and responds to live terminal output

### Key Innovations

#### 1. Unified Input Model
- Single command line that accepts both natural language and direct commands
- AI mode by default - just describe what you want
- Seamless mode switching (e.g., prefix with `/` for direct commands)
- Context preserved across mode switches

#### 2. Time-Step Observation
- AI takes periodic "snapshots" of terminal state rather than parsing every byte
- Configurable observation intervals (100ms for commands, 2s for monitoring)
- Intelligent triggering based on output changes
- Perfect for monitoring tools like htop, logs, or long-running processes

#### 3. Inline AI Thinking
```
> check system resources
[AI thinking: Running htop to monitor system resources...]
$ htop
[terminal shows htop output]
[AI observing: CPU at 85%, python process using most resources]

> that python process is eating too much cpu
[AI thinking: I'll help identify and manage that python process...]
$ ps aux | grep python
```

The AI's thoughts appear inline, maintaining chronological flow and creating a natural conversation transcript.

#### 4. Hierarchical Context Management
```
Mission: "Deploy the new API version"
  └─ Current Goal: "Run integration tests"
      └─ Current Task: "Fix failing auth test"
          └─ Observation: "JWT token error at line 47"
```

- Mission-level objectives persist throughout
- Automatic bookmarking of key moments (errors, solutions, configuration)
- Smart context pruning to maintain relevance
- Learning patterns extracted for future use

#### 5. Session Continuity
```
> continue yesterday's debugging session
[AI thinking: Loading context from 2024-01-08_api-debugging...]
[AI restored context: 
  - Mission: Debug API timeout issues
  - Progress: Identified connection pool exhaustion
  - Key finding: Connections not being released in /api/users route
]
Welcome back! Yesterday we found the connection leak. Should I continue where we left off?
```

### User Experience

#### Interaction Flow

1. **Natural Commands**: Type what you want to accomplish
   ```
   > find large files in my documents
   [AI executes]: Get-ChildItem -Path $env:USERPROFILE\Documents -Recurse | Where-Object {$_.Length -gt 100MB}
   ```

2. **Contextual Understanding**: AI maintains awareness of recent activity
   ```
   > what failed?
   [AI analyzes recent output and explains the error]
   ```

3. **Interruption and Guidance**: Redirect AI mid-execution
   ```
   > deploy to production
   [AI starts deployment process]
   > wait, first check if tests pass
   [AI adjusts plan and runs tests first]
   ```

4. **Multi-Terminal Orchestration**: Coordinate across sessions
   ```
   > run build in terminal 1, then if successful, deploy in terminal 2
   [AI orchestrates across multiple terminal instances]
   ```

#### Minimal UI Design

- **Main Terminal View**: Full terminal emulation with VT100/ANSI support
- **Unified Input Line**: Single input for both natural language and commands
- **Status Line**: Minimal indicator showing AI state (thinking/ready/observing)
- **Everything else through conversation**: Sessions, history, and context accessed via natural language

### Technical Architecture

#### Core Components

1. **Terminal Engine**
   - Windows ConPTY integration for full terminal emulation
   - VT sequence parsing and rendering
   - Multi-terminal session management

2. **AI Orchestration Layer**
   - Natural language understanding
   - Command generation and validation
   - Context management and memory
   - Time-step observation system

3. **Lightweight UI**
   - Terminal.Gui console-based interface
   - Runs inside existing terminal emulator
   - Minimal overhead, maximum performance

#### Data Persistence

- SQLite for session storage and context
- Encrypted storage for sensitive information
- Export/import for session sharing
- Incremental context updates

### Use Cases

#### Development Workflow
```
> set up a new react project with typescript and tailwind
[AI orchestrates: npm create, installs dependencies, configures files]
[User can intervene at any step]
```

#### System Administration
```
> monitor the web server and alert me if errors spike
[AI sets up log monitoring, watches for patterns]
[Continues monitoring even as user works on other tasks]
```

#### Learning and Exploration
```
> explain what this command does: find . -type f -mtime -7 -exec grep -l "TODO" {} \;
[AI breaks down each component and shows example output]
```
